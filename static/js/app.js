// /static/js/app.js - ES Module User Interface Interaction System
//
// This file implements the Module Pattern and Factory Pattern for sophisticated user interface
// interactions through SweetAlert2 integration, demonstrating how modern web applications can
// provide rich user feedback, modal dialogs, and interactive workflows while maintaining clean
// code organization and reusable component architecture. It serves as the primary JavaScript
// module that handles user interface interactions throughout the application, providing consistent
// interaction patterns and user feedback mechanisms that enhance the overall user experience.
//
// The ES Module approach provides several architectural and development advantages:
// 1. **Code Organization**: Clear module boundaries prevent global namespace pollution
// 2. **Dependency Management**: Explicit imports and exports create clear dependency relationships
// 3. **Reusability**: Module exports can be used across different application contexts
// 4. **Maintainability**: Focused module scope makes code easier to understand and modify
// 5. **Performance Benefits**: Module loading can be optimized for production deployment
// 6. **Modern Standards**: ES modules align with current JavaScript best practices and tooling
//
// The SweetAlert2 integration demonstrates how modern web applications can enhance user
// experience through sophisticated modal dialogs, notifications, and interactive elements
// that provide clear feedback and guidance while maintaining accessibility and cross-browser
// compatibility throughout different user interaction scenarios and workflow contexts.
//
// Design Pattern: ES Module System - modern JavaScript module organization and export
// Design Pattern: Factory Pattern - creates configured interaction utilities for application use
// Design Pattern: Facade Pattern - provides simplified interface to complex SweetAlert2 functionality

/**
 * Prompt implements the Factory Pattern for user interface interaction utilities creation.
 * This factory function creates a comprehensive suite of user interaction tools that provide
 * consistent interface patterns throughout the application, demonstrating how JavaScript modules
 * can encapsulate complex functionality behind simple, intuitive APIs that support various
 * user feedback requirements and interactive workflow needs across different application contexts.
 *
 * The Factory Pattern is particularly valuable for UI interaction systems because it:
 * 1. **Encapsulates Configuration**: Complex SweetAlert2 setup hidden behind simple interfaces
 * 2. **Provides Consistency**: All interaction patterns use the same underlying configuration approach
 * 3. **Enables Customization**: Factory parameters allow different interaction behaviors as needed
 * 4. **Simplifies Usage**: Application code uses simple method calls rather than complex API configuration
 * 5. **Supports Evolution**: Internal implementation can change without affecting calling code
 * 6. **Promotes Reusability**: Same factory can create different interaction patterns as needed
 *
 * The interaction suite covers the most common user feedback scenarios including success
 * notifications, error reporting, informational dialogs, and custom interactive workflows
 * that require user input and provide dynamic responses based on user selections and preferences.
 *
 * Design Pattern: Factory Method - creates configured interaction utilities
 * Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern - different interaction strategies for different user feedback needs
 * Design Pattern: Command Pattern - encapsulates user interaction requests as method calls
 * 
 * @returns {Object} Comprehensive suite of user interface interaction utilities ready for application use

  // Toast Notification System - Subtle User Feedback and Status Communication
  // 
  // The toast notification system provides unobtrusive user feedback that appears temporarily
  // to communicate status, success, or informational messages without interrupting user workflow.
  // This approach balances user awareness with interface usability, providing feedback that
  // users can acknowledge or ignore based on their current focus and task requirements.

  /**
   * toast implements the Observer Pattern for non-intrusive user notification display.
   * This method creates temporary notification displays that provide user feedback without
   * interrupting workflow or requiring explicit user acknowledgment, demonstrating how modern
   * web applications can provide status communication that enhances user awareness while
   * maintaining focus on primary tasks and interface interactions.
   *
   * Toast notifications are particularly effective for:
   * 1. **Success Confirmation**: Brief acknowledgment of completed actions
   * 2. **Status Updates**: Non-critical information about system state changes  
   * 3. **Background Processes**: Updates about operations that don't require immediate attention
   * 4. **Subtle Warnings**: Gentle alerts that don't warrant modal interruption
   * 5. **Progress Communication**: Brief updates about ongoing processes or workflows
   *
   * The toast system uses sophisticated timing and interaction patterns that pause when
   * users hover over notifications, enabling users to read content at their own pace while
   * ensuring that notifications don't accumulate or create interface clutter over time.
   *
   * Design Pattern: Observer - provides user feedback without requiring explicit acknowledgment
   * Design Pattern: Temporal Display - automatically manages notification lifetime and cleanup
   * Design Pattern: Progressive Enhancement - enhances interface without breaking core functionality

   *
   * Effective error dialogs should:

   * 2. **Provide Guidance**: Suggest specific steps users can take to resolve problems
   * 3. **Maintain Hope**: Reassure users that problems can be resolved with appropriate action
   * 4. **Offer Support**: Provide pathways to additional help when self-service isn't sufficient
   * 5. **Learn from Issues**: Use error patterns to identify user experience improvement opportunities

/* JavaScript Module Architecture and Usage Guidelines:
   
   This ES module provides comprehensive user interface interaction capabilities through
   systematic factory patterns and consistent API design that scales across different
   application contexts while maintaining code organization and supporting team productivity
   throughout development and maintenance workflows.
   
   When working with this interaction module, consider the following usage patterns:
   
   1. **Direct Instance Usage**: Import `prompty` for immediate access to interaction utilities
      without additional setup or configuration requirements in most application contexts
   
   2. **Custom Configuration**: Import `Prompt` factory when specific configuration requirements
      differ from default behavior or when multiple interaction instances need different behavior
   
   3. **Callback Integration**: Use callback functions with custom dialogs to integrate user
      interaction results with application logic and workflow continuation requirements
   
   4. **Async/Await Support**: Custom dialog methods return promises that support modern
      JavaScript async patterns for complex workflow coordination and error handling
   
   5. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error handling for dialog failures or user
      cancellation to ensure robust application behavior across all user interaction scenarios
   
   The module architecture supports both simple usage patterns and complex interaction
   requirements while maintaining consistency and providing clear separation between
   interaction utilities and application business logic throughout development workflows.
   
   Performance Considerations and Loading Strategy:
   
   The ES module approach enables efficient loading and tree-shaking in modern build systems,
   allowing applications to include only the interaction functionality they actually use
   while maintaining small bundle sizes and optimal loading performance for production deployment.
   
   The SweetAlert2 integration provides sophisticated interaction capabilities while maintaining
   reasonable bundle size impact through its optimized library design and selective feature usage
   throughout the interaction utility implementation and application integration patterns.
   
   Future enhancement opportunities include additional interaction patterns like multi-step
   wizards, advanced form validation, real-time data integration, and enhanced accessibility
   features, all following the same systematic approach to module organization and API design
   demonstrated by the current interaction utility foundation and development patterns.
