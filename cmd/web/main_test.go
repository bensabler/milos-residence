// TestRun implements the Application Bootstrap Testing pattern for comprehensive initialization verification.
// This test validates that the application's complete startup sequence executes successfully without errors,
// including database connection establishment, template compilation, session management configuration,
// dependency injection, and all other critical initialization steps required for proper application operation.
//
// Bootstrap testing is essential for web applications because it verifies that the complex initialization
// sequence works correctly across different environments and deployment scenarios. The test ensures that:
// 1. **Startup Reliability**: Application can start successfully in automated testing environments
// 2. **Environment Portability**: Initialization logic works across development, testing, and production
// 3. **Dependency Validation**: All required external dependencies are available and properly configured
// 4. **Configuration Integrity**: Environment variables and configuration files are correctly processed
// 5. **Service Integration**: Database, template, session, and other services initialize without conflicts
//
// This test serves as a critical smoke test that catches configuration problems, missing dependencies,
// and initialization logic errors that could prevent the application from starting in production.
// It provides early detection of deployment issues and ensures that the application bootstrap
// process remains robust as the codebase evolves and new services are added.
//
// The test deliberately calls the same run() function used by main(), ensuring that the test
// environment exercises the identical initialization code path that production deployments use.
// This approach provides high confidence that successful test execution correlates directly
// with successful production deployment and application startup.
//
// Design Pattern: Application Bootstrap Testing - validates complete application initialization sequence
// Design Pattern: Smoke Testing - provides early detection of fundamental application startup problems
// Design Pattern: Integration Testing - tests coordination between multiple application subsystems
// Parameters:
//
//	t: Testing framework controller for test execution, reporting, and failure management
func TestRun(t *testing.T) {
	// Execute the complete application initialization sequence using the same code path
	// that production deployments use during startup. This ensures that testing validates
	// the actual production initialization logic rather than a simplified test-specific version.
	//
	// The run() function orchestrates the entire application bootstrap process including:
	// - Environment variable processing and configuration loading
	// - Database connection establishment and health verification
	// - Template compilation and caching system initialization
	// - Session management configuration and security setup
	// - Dependency injection and service wiring
	// - Error handling and resource management setup
	// - Logging system configuration for operational monitoring
	//
	// By calling run() directly, this test exercises the same complex initialization
	// sequence that main() executes, providing realistic validation of startup behavior
	_, err := run()

	// Validate that application initialization completed successfully without errors
	// Any non-nil error indicates a fundamental problem with the application bootstrap
	// process that would prevent successful deployment and operation in production
	if err != nil {
		// Application initialization failed - this represents a critical failure that
		// prevents the application from starting and serving requests. The error could
		// indicate problems with database connectivity, template compilation, configuration
		// processing, or other essential initialization steps that must succeed for proper operation.
		//
		// Failure scenarios that this test detects include:
		// - Database connection failures due to network issues or incorrect credentials
		// - Template compilation errors from syntax problems or missing template files
		// - Configuration errors from invalid environment variables or missing settings
		// - Service initialization failures from dependency conflicts or resource constraints
		// - Security setup problems with session management or CSRF token configuration
		//
		// The test failure message is intentionally concise while the actual error details
		// are captured in the error value returned by run(), enabling developers to
		// diagnose the specific cause of initialization failure through test output
		t.Error("Failed run()")
	}

	// Successful test completion indicates that the application initialization sequence
	// worked correctly and that all essential services were properly configured and started.
	// This provides confidence that the application can be deployed successfully and will
	// start correctly in production environments with similar configuration and dependencies.
	//
	// However, this test focuses specifically on initialization success rather than
	// comprehensive functional testing. Additional testing is needed to validate:
	// - HTTP request handling and response generation correctness
	// - Database operations and transaction handling under various conditions
	// - Template rendering with different data scenarios and edge cases
	// - Session management behavior across multiple user interactions
	// - Error handling and recovery mechanisms during normal operation
	// - Performance characteristics under realistic load conditions
	//
	// The bootstrap test serves as the foundation for more sophisticated testing by
	// ensuring that the application can start successfully before other tests attempt
	// to exercise specific functionality or performance characteristics
