// TestRoutes implements the Router Factory Testing pattern for route configuration verification.
// This test validates that the routes function correctly creates and configures the application's
// HTTP router with all necessary middleware, route mappings, and static file handling. It demonstrates
// how to test complex router configuration without requiring actual HTTP requests or server startup,
// focusing on the structural correctness of the routing infrastructure.
//
// Router configuration testing is crucial for web applications because:
// 1. **Integration Verification**: Ensures all application components integrate correctly in the router
// 2. **Type Safety**: Validates that router creation returns the expected concrete type
// 3. **Configuration Validation**: Confirms that router factory functions work with minimal configuration
// 4. **Regression Prevention**: Detects configuration changes that might break routing behavior
// 5. **Architecture Compliance**: Verifies that routing follows established architectural patterns
//
// This test focuses on the router factory pattern rather than individual route behavior, which is
// more appropriately tested through integration tests that make actual HTTP requests to verify
// end-to-end functionality including middleware execution, handler processing, and response generation.
//
// The test validates that the routes function properly implements the Factory Method pattern by
// accepting application configuration and returning a correctly configured router instance ready
// for use by the HTTP server infrastructure.
//
// Design Pattern: Router Factory Testing - validates factory function behavior and return types
// Design Pattern: Configuration Testing - tests router creation with minimal valid configuration
// Design Pattern: Type Assertion Testing - verifies concrete type returned by factory function
func TestRoutes(t *testing.T) {
	// Create minimal application configuration for router factory testing
	// The routes function requires an AppConfig parameter, but for structural testing
	// we only need to verify that the function accepts the configuration type and
	// returns a properly configured router without requiring fully initialized services
	var app config.AppConfig

	// Invoke router factory function with minimal configuration
	// This tests the routes function's ability to create a router instance using
	// the Factory Method pattern, accepting application configuration as a parameter
	// and returning a fully configured HTTP handler ready for server integration
	mux := routes(&app)

	// Perform type assertion to verify router factory returns expected concrete type
	// This validation ensures that the routes function returns a chi.Mux router instance
	// rather than some other type that might satisfy the http.Handler interface but
	// lack the specific features and behavior expected from the chi routing library
	switch v := mux.(type) {
	case *chi.Mux:
		// Success path: router factory correctly returns chi.Mux instance
		// This indicates that the routes function properly implements the Factory Method
		// pattern and creates the expected router type with correct configuration,
		// middleware chain setup, route mappings, and static file handling
		//
		// The chi.Mux type provides:
		// - Efficient URL pattern matching and parameter extraction
		// - Middleware chain processing with proper request/response handling
		// - RESTful route organization with support for HTTP method routing
		// - Sub-router capabilities for modular application organization
		// - Static file serving integration for asset delivery
		//
		// No additional action needed here - successful type assertion indicates
		// that the router factory function works correctly and returns the expected
		// router implementation ready for HTTP server integration
	default:
		// Failure path: router factory returns unexpected type
		// Report the actual type returned for debugging router factory implementation
		// This error would indicate fundamental problems with the routes function that
		// could prevent the HTTP server from starting or cause runtime type errors
		//
		// Common causes of this error might include:
		// - Incorrect return statement in routes function
		// - Wrong router library imported or configured
		// - Configuration issues that prevent proper router creation
		// - Refactoring errors that changed the router factory interface
		t.Errorf("type is not *chi.Mux, but is %T", v)
	}

	// Additional considerations for comprehensive router testing:
	//
	// While this test validates the basic factory function behavior and return type,
	// production applications often benefit from additional router testing including:
	//
	// 1. **Route Coverage Testing**: Verify that all expected routes are registered
	//    by making test HTTP requests to each route and confirming appropriate responses
	//
	// 2. **Middleware Chain Testing**: Validate that middleware is applied in correct order
	//    and that each middleware component functions properly within the chain
	//
	// 3. **Static File Handling**: Test that static assets are served correctly with
	//    appropriate MIME types, caching headers, and security considerations
	//
	// 4. **Parameter Extraction**: Verify that URL parameters are correctly extracted
	//    and passed to handlers for routes that include dynamic segments
	//
	// 5. **Method Routing**: Confirm that HTTP methods are correctly routed to
	//    appropriate handlers and that unsupported methods return appropriate errors
	//
	// These additional tests would typically be implemented as integration tests
	// that create test HTTP servers and make actual requests to verify end-to-end
	// routing behavior rather than just structural correctness of router creation.
