// TestMain implements the Test Suite Setup pattern for package-level test initialization.
// This function serves as the entry point for all tests in this package, providing a centralized
// location for test environment setup, resource allocation, and cleanup operations that should
// occur once per test suite execution rather than once per individual test case.
//
// The TestMain pattern is particularly valuable for web application testing because it:
// 1. **Environment Setup**: Configures test-specific environment variables and settings
// 2. **Resource Management**: Initializes expensive resources like database connections or server instances
// 3. **Test Isolation**: Ensures tests start with a clean, predictable environment state
// 4. **Performance Optimization**: Avoids repetitive setup/teardown in individual tests
// 5. **Integration Testing**: Configures complex test scenarios requiring external services
//
// Using TestMain enables sophisticated test scenarios while maintaining fast execution through
// shared resource management and eliminating redundant initialization code across test cases.
//
// Design Pattern: Test Suite Setup - centralized test environment initialization
// Design Pattern: Resource Management - handles expensive test resource lifecycle
// Design Pattern: Template Method - defines test execution framework with setup/teardown hooks
// Parameters:
//
//	m: Testing framework controller providing test execution and result reporting
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	// Execute all tests in this package and capture results
	// m.Run() discovers and executes all test functions (Test*) in the package,
	// collecting results and providing exit status based on overall test success or failure
	//
	// The os.Exit call ensures that the test process terminates with an appropriate
	// exit code that reflects the overall test results, enabling integration with
	// continuous integration systems and build pipelines that depend on exit codes
	// to determine build success or failure status
	//
	// Test execution flow:
	// 1. TestMain setup operations (if any) execute before all tests
	// 2. m.Run() discovers and executes individual test functions
	// 3. TestMain cleanup operations (if any) execute after all tests
	// 4. os.Exit terminates with success (0) or failure (non-zero) exit code
	os.Exit(m.Run())

// myHandler implements the Test Double pattern for minimal HTTP handler testing.
// This struct provides a lightweight, controllable handler implementation that satisfies
// the http.Handler interface without performing complex operations or requiring external
// dependencies. It demonstrates how test doubles can provide predictable, fast behavior
// for testing middleware, routing, and other HTTP infrastructure components.
//
// Test doubles are essential for effective middleware testing because they:
// 1. **Eliminate Dependencies**: Tests run without requiring real business logic or external services
// 2. **Provide Predictability**: Handler behavior is completely controlled and deterministic
// 3. **Enable Focus**: Tests concentrate on middleware behavior rather than handler implementation
// 4. **Improve Performance**: Minimal handlers execute quickly without complex processing overhead
// 5. **Support Isolation**: Each test can use independent handler instances without side effects
//
// The no-op implementation is intentionally minimal because middleware tests focus on
// verifying middleware behavior (interface compliance, request processing, response modification)
// rather than testing the business logic that would normally be implemented in real handlers.
//
// Design Pattern: Test Double - provides minimal implementation for testing purposes
// Design Pattern: Null Object - safe, no-op implementation that satisfies interface requirements
// Design Pattern: Stub - minimal implementation that provides predictable behavior for testing
type myHandler struct{} // Empty struct requires no memory allocation and provides clean test isolation

// ServeHTTP implements the http.Handler interface with no-op behavior for middleware testing.
// This method provides the minimal implementation required to satisfy the http.Handler interface
// contract while avoiding any side effects or complex processing that could interfere with
// middleware testing scenarios. It demonstrates how test doubles can provide interface
// compliance without implementing actual business functionality.
//
// The no-op implementation is strategically chosen for middleware testing because:
// 1. **Interface Satisfaction**: Provides valid http.Handler implementation for middleware wrapping
// 2. **Side Effect Elimination**: No database calls, file operations, or external service interactions
// 3. **Performance Optimization**: Minimal processing overhead enables fast test execution
// 4. **Test Isolation**: No shared state or global side effects that could affect other tests
// 5. **Focus Maintenance**: Tests concentrate on middleware behavior rather than handler complexity
//
// Middleware tests wrap this handler with the middleware being tested, then verify that:
// - The wrapped result still implements http.Handler interface correctly
// - Middleware processing occurs as expected during request handling
// - Response modification and request context manipulation work properly
// - Error handling and edge cases are managed appropriately
//
// Design Pattern: Null Object - safe implementation with no side effects
// Design Pattern: Interface Implementation - minimal code to satisfy contract requirements
// Design Pattern: Test Stub - predictable behavior that supports deterministic testing
// Parameters:
//
//	w: HTTP response writer (unused in no-op implementation)
//	r: HTTP request (unused in no-op implementation)
func (mh *myHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Intentionally empty implementation for testing purposes
	// This no-op behavior provides the interface compliance needed for middleware testing
	// while avoiding any side effects that could interfere with test reliability or performance.
	//
	// In actual middleware tests, the middleware wraps this handler and performs its own
	// operations (CSRF token validation, session loading, request logging, etc.) before
	// or after calling this ServeHTTP method. The middleware behavior is what's being tested,
	// not the handler implementation, so minimal handler code is beneficial for test clarity.
	//
	// Production handlers would contain substantial business logic here:
	// - Database queries and business rule processing
	// - Template rendering and response generation
	// - User authentication and authorization checks
	// - Integration with external services and APIs
	// - Complex error handling and recovery logic
	//
	// For testing, this complexity is unnecessary and potentially harmful because it could
	// introduce variables that make middleware testing unreliable or slow.
