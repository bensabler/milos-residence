// session implements the Test Session Management pattern for render package testing infrastructure.
// This package-level session manager provides controlled session functionality specifically configured
// for testing template rendering scenarios that depend on session data like flash messages, CSRF tokens,
// and user state information. It demonstrates how testing environments can replicate production session
// behavior while maintaining test isolation, predictability, and performance optimization.
//
// Session management in testing environments requires different configuration than production because:
// 1. **Test Isolation**: Each test needs independent session state without interference from other tests
// 2. **Performance Optimization**: Test sessions prioritize speed over security for rapid test execution
// 3. **Predictable Behavior**: Test sessions provide consistent, deterministic behavior across test runs
// 4. **Simplified Security**: Test environments can use relaxed security settings for easier test setup
// 5. **Resource Management**: Test sessions optimize memory usage and cleanup for efficient test execution
//
// The test session manager uses in-memory storage and simplified configuration that enables comprehensive
// testing of session-dependent template features while maintaining the fast, reliable test execution
// needed for continuous integration and development workflows.
//
// Design Pattern: Test Session Management - session functionality optimized for testing scenarios
// Design Pattern: Service Configuration - test-specific configuration for shared testing infrastructure
var session *scs.SessionManager

// testApp implements the Test Application Configuration pattern for render package testing setup.
// This configuration container provides all the application-wide settings and services needed for
// comprehensive template rendering testing, including logging, session management, and environment
// flags that control template behavior. It demonstrates how testing environments can replicate
// production application configuration while optimizing for test-specific requirements.
//
// Test application configuration serves several critical functions:
// 1. **Service Integration**: Provides access to logging, session management, and other cross-cutting services
// 2. **Behavior Control**: Environment flags control template caching, error handling, and security features
// 3. **Test Isolation**: Independent configuration prevents test interference and ensures predictable behavior
// 4. **Resource Management**: Optimized configuration reduces resource usage during test execution
// 5. **Error Handling**: Test-appropriate error logging and handling improves test debugging and development
//
// The test configuration balances realistic service behavior with test performance and simplicity,
// enabling comprehensive validation of template functionality without the complexity and overhead
// of full production configuration and external service dependencies.
//
// Design Pattern: Test Application Configuration - application settings optimized for testing scenarios
// Design Pattern: Dependency Injection Container - centralized service access for test infrastructure
var testApp config.AppConfig

// TestMain implements the Test Suite Initialization pattern for render package testing infrastructure.
// This function serves as the centralized setup point for all render package tests, configuring the
// complete testing environment including session management, logging, application configuration, and
// service initialization. It demonstrates how complex testing environments can be established once
// per test suite to improve performance and ensure consistent test conditions across all scenarios.
//
// Test suite initialization provides several architectural and performance benefits:
// 1. **Performance Optimization**: Expensive setup operations performed once rather than per individual test
// 2. **Environment Consistency**: All tests execute with identical configuration and service dependencies
// 3. **Resource Management**: Test resources allocated and managed systematically with proper cleanup
// 4. **Service Integration**: Complex service dependencies configured correctly for realistic testing
// 5. **Error Prevention**: Initialization problems detected early before individual tests execute
//
// The initialization sequence replicates the essential parts of production application startup while
// using test-optimized configuration that prioritizes speed, predictability, and debugging support
// over production security and scalability requirements.
//
// Design Pattern: Test Suite Initialization - centralized setup for comprehensive testing infrastructure
// Design Pattern: Environment Configuration - test-specific environment setup and dependency management
// Design Pattern: Service Lifecycle Management - proper initialization and cleanup of testing services
// Parameters:
//
//	m: Testing framework controller that manages test discovery, execution, and result reporting

	// Register data types for session serialization during template testing
	// Template rendering often involves session data access for flash messages, user state,
	// and other information that must be serialized for storage between HTTP requests.
	// Go's gob package requires explicit type registration for complex object serialization,
	// ensuring that business objects can be stored in and retrieved from session storage
	// during realistic testing scenarios that simulate multi-request user workflows.
	//
	// Type registration is critical for session-based testing because:
	// - Session data must survive serialization for storage between test requests
	// - Complex business objects need explicit registration to prevent serialization panics
	// - Template tests often store realistic business data to validate template rendering
	// - Missing type registration causes runtime failures during session data access
	gob.Register(models.Reservation{})

	// Configure test environment for development-friendly template testing behavior
	// Setting InProduction = false enables test-appropriate settings including:
	// - HTTP cookies without HTTPS requirements for simplified test client usage
	// - Detailed error messages in logs for effective test debugging and problem diagnosis
	// - Relaxed security settings appropriate for isolated testing environments
	// - Template caching behavior optimized for test performance rather than production scale
	//
	// Development mode settings facilitate comprehensive testing while maintaining security
	// appropriate for test environments that don't handle real user data or external traffic
	testApp.InProduction = false

	// Initialize operational logging for template test execution monitoring
	// Info logging provides visibility into template processing, cache operations, and
	// rendering workflows during test execution, enabling effective debugging when tests
	// fail or exhibit unexpected behavior. Test logging helps developers understand
	// template system behavior and diagnose issues with template compilation or rendering.
	//
	// Test logging configuration balances information visibility with test performance,
	// providing enough detail for effective debugging without overwhelming test output
	// or significantly impacting test execution speed during development workflows
	infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO:\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)

	// Initialize error logging with enhanced context for comprehensive test debugging
	// Error logging with file and line information (log.Lshortfile) enables rapid
	// identification of error sources during test execution, supporting efficient
	// debugging and problem resolution when template tests encounter failures or
	// unexpected conditions that require developer investigation and correction.
	//
	// Enhanced error logging is particularly valuable for template testing because
	// template errors can be complex, involving file system access, template syntax,
	// data binding, and session integration issues that benefit from detailed context
	errorLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "ERROR:\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
	testApp.ErrorLog = errorLog

	// Initialize session management infrastructure for template testing scenarios
	// Template rendering frequently depends on session data for flash messages, CSRF tokens,
	// user authentication state, and other information that affects template content and
	// behavior. Realistic session management enables comprehensive testing of template
	// functionality that depends on user session state and multi-request workflows.
	//
	// Session configuration for testing prioritizes predictable behavior and test performance:
	session = scs.New()
	session.Lifetime = 24 * time.Hour              // Generous session lifetime prevents test failures due to expiration
	session.Cookie.Persist = true                  // Session persistence enables multi-request test scenarios
	session.Cookie.SameSite = http.SameSiteLaxMode // Relaxed SameSite policy supports cross-origin test scenarios
	session.Cookie.Secure = false                  // HTTP-only cookies acceptable for test environments

	// Configure application with session manager for template rendering testing
	// Template functions and rendering operations require access to session management
	// through application configuration, maintaining the same dependency injection
	// patterns used in production while operating with test-optimized configuration
	testApp.Session = session

	// Initialize render package with test application configuration
	// Package initialization provides the render package with access to logging,
	// session management, and other cross-cutting services needed for comprehensive
	// template rendering functionality during test execution and validation scenarios
	app = &testApp

	// Execute all render package tests and terminate with appropriate exit status
	// m.Run() discovers and executes all test functions in the package, collecting
	// results and providing exit codes that integrate with build systems and continuous
	// integration pipelines for automated test result reporting and build success/failure determination
	//
	// os.Exit ensures that the test process terminates with correct exit status codes:
	// - Exit code 0 indicates all tests passed successfully
	// - Non-zero exit codes indicate test failures that require developer attention
	// - Build systems use exit codes to determine overall build success or failure
	os.Exit(m.Run())
