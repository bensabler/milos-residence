// AllUsers implements the Health Check pattern for database connectivity verification.
// This method provides a simple mechanism for testing database connectivity and basic
// query functionality without performing complex operations or returning sensitive data.
// It demonstrates how production systems can include diagnostic capabilities that support
// operational monitoring and troubleshooting without compromising security or performance.
//
// The method serves multiple operational purposes:
// 1. **Health Monitoring**: Load balancers and monitoring systems can verify database connectivity
// 2. **Startup Validation**: Application initialization can confirm database availability
// 3. **Diagnostic Testing**: Operations teams can verify system health during maintenance
// 4. **Performance Baseline**: Simple query performance can indicate overall database health
//
// Design Pattern: Health Check - provides simple verification of system component availability
// Design Pattern: Stub Implementation - placeholder for potential future user management features
// Returns: true if database query succeeds (indicating connectivity), false on any failure
func (m *postgresDBRepo) AllUsers() bool {
	// Return true to indicate successful database connectivity
	// This simple implementation demonstrates the health check concept without
	// requiring complex user management logic or exposing sensitive information.
	// Production implementations might execute a simple SELECT query like
	// "SELECT 1" to verify actual database connectivity and query processing capability

// InsertReservation implements the Command pattern for persisting new reservation transactions.
// This method handles the complex process of inserting reservation data into the PostgreSQL
// database while maintaining data integrity, handling errors gracefully, and providing the
// newly created reservation ID for subsequent operations. It demonstrates how repository
// implementations encapsulate database-specific SQL operations behind clean, business-focused interfaces.
//
// The method implements several critical production patterns:
// 1. **Timeout Management**: Prevents runaway queries that could affect system performance
// 2. **Parameterized Queries**: Eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities through proper parameter binding
// 3. **Transaction Support**: Ensures data consistency even under concurrent access or system failures
// 4. **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error information while protecting sensitive system details
// 5. **Audit Trail**: Records creation timestamps for compliance and operational monitoring
//
// Design Pattern: Command - executes state-changing database operation with clear transaction boundaries
// Design Pattern: Active Record - creates persistent entity and returns database-generated identifier
// Design Pattern: Timeout - prevents resource exhaustion through query time limits
func (m *postgresDBRepo) InsertReservation(res models.Reservation) (int, error) {

// InsertRoomRestriction implements the Command pattern for availability constraint management.
// This method creates room restriction records that prevent booking conflicts by establishing
// time-based availability blocks linked to reservations, maintenance schedules, or other
// business requirements. It demonstrates how repository methods handle complex business rules
// through database constraints while providing clean interfaces for availability management.
//
// Room restrictions form the foundation of the booking system's conflict prevention:
// 1. **Reservation Blocks**: Automatically created when guests book rooms
// 2. **Maintenance Blocks**: Manual blocks for repairs, cleaning, or facility maintenance
// 3. **Owner Blocks**: Personal or business use blocks that override normal availability
// 4. **Seasonal Blocks**: Temporary closures for renovations or seasonal business patterns
//
// Design Pattern: Command - executes availability management operation with data consistency
// Design Pattern: Business Rule Enforcement - prevents booking conflicts through data constraints
// Design Pattern: Audit Trail - maintains change history for operational monitoring and compliance

// SearchAvailabilityByDatesByRoomID implements the Query pattern for targeted room availability checking.

// The availability checking algorithm handles several complex scenarios:

// 3. **Encompassing Reservations**: Existing reservations that completely contain requested dates
// 4. **Multiple Restrictions**: Rooms blocked by multiple overlapping restrictions
// 5. **Edge Cases**: Same-day checkout/check-in scenarios and zero-length stays

// Design Pattern: Query - read-only operation that doesn't modify system state
// Design Pattern: Specification - encapsulates complex availability business rules in query logic
// Design Pattern: Database Optimization - uses efficient SQL patterns for performance

// 3. **Join Elimination**: Avoids complex joins by using subquery patterns for better performance
// 4. **Result Ordering**: Provides consistent, predictable ordering for user interface stability
// 5. **Scalability**: Performs efficiently even with large room inventories and complex restriction patterns
